## Emphasizing Return Types

While not mandatory, annotating return types in TypeScript functions is highly encouraged ([eslint rule](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/explicit-function-return-type/)). Here's why:

- **Clarity**: They make the expected return type clear to anyone interacting with the code.
- **Avoiding Errors**: They prevent misuse of `undefined` values when a return value isn't intended.
- **Early Error Detection**: They allow for faster identification of type errors, especially during future code changes.
- **Refactoring Support**: They ease refactoring by ensuring the correct type assignment.
- **Design Thinking**: Similar to Test-Driven Development (TDD), pre-defining return types encourages thoughtful design discussion.
- **Compiler Efficiency**: Although TypeScript's type inference is powerful, explicit return types can make the compiler's job easier.

### Consider the following

```ts
// With explicit return type
function getUser(id: string): User {
  // Implementation here
}

// Without return type - still valid but less clear
function getProduct(id: number) {
  // Implementation here
}
```

In conclusion, using return types can enhance the quality, maintainability, and efficiency of your TypeScript code. It's an optional but valuable practice.
