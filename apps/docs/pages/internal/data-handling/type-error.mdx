## Managing Type Errors

When a TypeScript error is unresolvable, you may need to suppress it. The recommended approach is using `@ts-expect-error`, as it also checks if the suppressed line becomes error-free in the future ([eslint rule](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/prefer-ts-expect-error/)).

Avoid using `@ts-ignore`, as it lacks these checks. Instead, use `@ts-expect-error` with an accompanying description ([eslint rule](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/ban-ts-comment/#allow-with-description)).

Here's how to use it correctly:

```ts
// ❌ Avoid @ts-ignore
// @ts-ignore
const result = doSomething('hello');

// ✅ Use @ts-expect-error with description
// @ts-expect-error: the library definition is wrong
const result = doSomething('hello');
```

Utilizing `@ts-expect-error` in the right way ensures a balance between suppressing necessary errors and maintaining code quality.
