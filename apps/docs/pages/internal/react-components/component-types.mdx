## Component Types in React

React components are divided into specific types, each serving a unique role within the application. Here's a guide to understanding these types.

### Container Components

Container components, often postfixed with "Container" or "Page," serve as the backbone of a feature within a React application.

- **Naming Convention**: Use "Container" for generic containers, "Page" for web pages (e.g., `[ComponentName]Container|Page`).
- **Examples**: `AddUserContainer.tsx`, `EditProductContainer.tsx`, `ProductsPage.tsx`.
- **Responsibilities**: Business logic, API integration, coordination of child components.
- **Directory Structure**:
  ```
  ProductsPage/
  ├─ api/
  │  └─ useGetProducts/
  ├─ components/
  │  └─ ProductItem/
  ├─ utils/
  │  └─ filterProductsByType/
  └─ index.tsx
  ```

### UI - Feature Components

These are representational components created to meet specific feature requirements within a container.

- **Location**: Nested inside the container component folder.
- **Conventions**: Should adhere to [functions conventions](#functions) for consistency.
- **Structure**:
  ```
  ProductItem/
  ├─ index.tsx
  ├─ ProductItem.stories.tsx
  └─ ProductItem.test.tsx
  ```
- **Note**: Unlike containers, these components don't handle API integrations.

### UI - Design System Components

These are global components that are reusable and shared across the entire codebase.

- **Use**: Ideal for building a consistent UI design across various parts of the application.
- **Structure**:
  ```
  Button/
  ├─ index.tsx
  ├─ Button.stories.tsx
  └─ Button.test.tsx
  ```
- **Best Practice**: Maintain a library of these components for efficient development.

By understanding these component types, developers can create well-structured, maintainable, and scalable React applications.
