## What & How To Test in React

Automated testing enhances code quality and eases refactoring, catching bugs early. Balance what and how to test for confidence without slowing the team.

### ✅ Do:

- **Write Clear Tests**: Tests should be short, simple, and convey intent instantly.
- **Test Business Logic**: Emulate user input and expected output rather than technical details.
- **Isolated Execution**: Ensure tests run standalone and don't depend on others.
- **Resilient Tests**: Query HTML elements by attributes unlikely to change. Follow [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about/#priority) query priority: [role](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/byrole), [label](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/bylabeltext), etc.

### ❌ Don't:

- **Avoid Testing Implementation**: Tests should remain intact when refactoring.
- **Avoid Re-testing Libraries**: Don't re-test what's already tested in libraries or frameworks.
- **Avoid 100% Code Coverage**: Strive for meaningful coverage, not just a percentage.
- **Avoid Testing for the Sake of Testing**:
  ```ts
  // ❌ Avoid
  it('should render user list', () => {
    render(<UserList />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Users List')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  ```

These guidelines foster a testing culture that prioritizes meaningful tests over quantity, focusing on what genuinely contributes to the application's reliability.
