## Required and Optional Arguments: A Balanced Approach

In the world of function design, striking the right balance between required and optional arguments is key. This can be achieved through the following principles:

1. **Emphasize Required Arguments**: Lean towards making most arguments required. This ensures that the essential information is provided, and the function behavior is well-defined.

2. **Use Optional Arguments Sparingly**: If your function starts to include a large number of optional parameters, it may be a sign that the function is trying to do too much. In these cases, it can lead to confusion and maintainability challenges.

3. **Break Down Complex Functions**: If a function becomes overly complex, it should probably be broken down into smaller, more manageable parts.

   For example, implementing ten separate functions with five required arguments each can often be a more maintainable and transparent solution than creating a single "jack-of-all-trades" function with fifty optional arguments.

### Underlying philosophy

- **Clarity over Convenience**: By focusing on required arguments and reducing optional ones, you emphasize clear expectations and reduce ambiguities.
- **Simplicity over Complexity**: Opt for straightforward solutions, even if it means implementing more functions. Itâ€™s a trade-off that often leads to more maintainable and scalable code.

In conclusion, being judicious in the use of required and optional arguments, and breaking down complex functions, fosters cleaner and more robust code, aligned with modern best practices.
