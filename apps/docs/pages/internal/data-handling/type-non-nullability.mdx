## Understanding Type & Non-nullability Assertions

Type assertions, like `brand as BrandType`, and non-nullability assertions, such as `brand!.name`, are potentially risky operations. These assertions only silence the TypeScript compiler and can lead to runtime errors that crash your application.

While these tools exist, their use should be minimized and restricted to situations where they are an absolute necessity. For instance, a mismatch with third-party library types might necessitate an assertion.

### Here's what you should be aware of

- **Avoid Unnecessary Usage**: Limit the use of assertions to exceptional cases where no other safe alternatives are available.
- **Provide Justification**: If an assertion is introduced into the codebase, it should be accompanied by a clear and strong rationale explaining why it is needed.

```ts
// ⚠️ Use with caution
const brandType = brand as BrandType; // Type assertion
const brandName = brand!.name; // Non-nullability assertion
```

By following these principles, you can maintain a more robust and reliable codebase that leverages TypeScript's type-checking capabilities without introducing unnecessary risks.
