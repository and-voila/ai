## Functions: Principles and Best Practices

When writing functions, adhering to certain conventions and principles derived from functional programming can lead to cleaner, more maintainable code. Here's a breakdown:

### General Guidelines

#### Single Responsibility

A function should have a single responsibility or task. This makes it easier to understand, test, and maintain.

#### Stateless Behavior

A function should be stateless, meaning that the same input arguments return the same value every single time. This predictability enhances testing and debugging.

#### Input and Output

A function should accept at least one argument and return data. This enforces clear contracts between different parts of your code, facilitating better collaboration and understanding.

#### Purity and Side Effects

A function should strive to be pure, meaning it doesn't have side effects. Side effects occur when a function modifies or accesses variables outside its local environment (such as global state or external data fetching). Avoiding these makes the function's behavior more predictable and easier to test.

By following these principles, you create functions that are more robust, easier to test, and aligned with fundamental functional programming concepts. These practices promote a codebase that is more resilient and maintainable.
