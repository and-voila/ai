## Snapshot Testing in React

Snapshot tests, while convenient, are generally discouraged due to their fragility. They can lead to a mindset of "just update it" to pass the tests, undermining the purpose of testing.

### Why Avoid Snapshot Tests?

- **Fragility**: Small changes can lead to test failures, tempting developers to simply update the snapshot without proper review.
- **Lack of Clarity**: It's often unclear what exactly is being tested, leading to false confidence.

### Exceptions to the Rule

Despite these challenges, exceptions can be made when:

- **Clear Intent**: The test output is short and the intent of what's being tested is clear.
- **Critical Elements**: For critical elements that must not deviate, such as in a design system library.

In these scenarios, a strong rationale must back the use of snapshot tests to ensure that they add value and do not become a maintenance burden.

By being mindful of when to use snapshot testing, developers can create more robust and meaningful test suites that truly verify the functionality of their code.
