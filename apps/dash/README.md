# ü™Ñ Bringing the Magic Together

Building the `app`, our main user interface, is like making a magical potion. We've carefully chosen top-tier tech like Next JS, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, all hosted on Vercel. This blend works seamlessly, like one of Charlie's weird food combos - but way more appealing!

Big thanks to the open-source community. We've whipped up a balanced recipe, avoiding any chaotic mixes. We picked the best ingredients to make something amazing with endless potential.

With Vercel as conductor, we're ready to unveil the **app** hosted inside the `/dash` workspace. Why the dash? Well Sam finds it hard to keep track of all the apps inside of `apps` and `app`. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
