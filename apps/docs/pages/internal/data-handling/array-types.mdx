## Defining Array Types Using Generic Syntax

In TypeScript, defining array types with generic syntax is a widely-accepted practice. Following this pattern not only maintains code consistency but also adheres to the [eslint rule](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/array-type/#generic) that encourages this syntax.

Below, you'll find a comparison between the conventional array syntax and the preferred generic syntax:

```ts
// ❌ Avoid this
const x: string[] = ['a', 'b'];
const y: readonly string[] = ['a', 'b'];

// ✅ Instead, use this
const x: Array<string> = ['a', 'b'];
const y: ReadonlyArray<string> = ['a', 'b'];
```

By employing the generic syntax for array types, you can make your TypeScript code more flexible, clear, and maintainable.
