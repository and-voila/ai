## User Guide TLDR - Key Points

These are some of the most important conventions to keep in mind:

- **Code organization** - Collocate code with where it is used. Group by features. [&#11107;](#code-collocation)

- **Immutability** - Favor immutable data and pure functions without side effects. [&#11107;](#data-immutability)

- **Function purity** - Functions should be stateless, single responsibility. [&#11107;](#functions)

- **Required arguments** - Use required args over optional. [&#11107;](#required--optional-args)

- **Naming** - Use consistent, intention-revealing naming. [&#11107;](#naming-conventions)

- **Exports** - Use named exports over default exports. [&#11107;](#named-export)

- **Data fetching** - Use react-query or Apollo Client for data retrieval. [&#11107;](#store--pass-data)

- **Global state** - Avoid global state management libraries. [&#11107;](#store--pass-data)

- **Components** - Only display data and emit events. No business logic. [&#11107;](#component-types)

- **Testing** - Test behavior, not implementation. [&#11107;](#what--how-to-test)

While this guide cannot cover everything, these principles establish a solid foundation. Lean on consistency, immutability, purity, intention-revealing code and testing the right things.
