## Const Assertion - A TypeScript Best Practice

Using const assertions in TypeScript (via `as const`) enhances code quality by ensuring:

- **Type Narrowing:** The type is made more specific.
- **Readonly Properties:** Objects are given `readonly` attributes.
- **Readonly Tuples:** Arrays are transformed into `readonly` tuples.

This practice reinforces immutability and adds an extra layer of protection against unintentional modifications.

### Examples

Here's how to apply const assertions:

### Bad

```ts
// ❌ Avoid declaring constants without const assertion
const BASE_LOCATION = { x: 50, y: 130 }; // Type { x: number; y: number; }
BASE_LOCATION.x = 10;
const BASE_LOCATION = [50, 130]; // Type number[]
BASE_LOCATION.push(10);
```

### Good

```ts
// ✅ Use const assertion
const BASE_LOCATION = { x: 50, y: 130 } as const; // Type '{ readonly x: 50; readonly y: 130; }'
const BASE_LOCATION = [50, 130] as const; // Type 'readonly [10, 20]'
```

By adhering to const assertions, you can make your code more concise, expressive, and less prone to errors. It aligns well with principles of data immutability and type safety.
