## Store & Pass Data in React

### Storing State in URL

Utilize the URL for storing state related to user interactions like filtering and sorting. It enhances user experience and bookmarking capabilities.

- **Avoid Syncing with Local State**: This can create unnecessary complexity and lead to potential inconsistencies.

### Passing Data

Strategies for passing data within components.

- **Props & URL**: Prefer simple mechanisms such as props or the URL for passing data between components.
- **Global State**: Use global state management like Zustand or Context only when absolutely necessary, as it can add complexity.

### Compound Components

Use compound components when elements need to function together (e.g., menus, tabs).

- **Exporting Strategy**: Export components in a way that maintains type integrity and clear usage:
  ```tsx
  export const PriceList = PriceListRoot as typeof PriceListRoot & {
    Item: typeof PriceListItem;
  };
  PriceList.Item = PriceListItem;
  ```

### UI Components

UI components should be kept simple and focused on their visual responsibilities.

- **Derived State & Events**: They should only display derived state and send events, avoiding business logic or state management.

### Prop Drilling

Managing how properties are passed through a component tree.

- **Embrace Prop Drilling**: It's a normal pattern in React, and issues can often be resolved through refactoring or composition rather than resorting to global state.

### Data Fetching

Strategies for retrieving data within your application.

- **Container Components**: Limit data fetching to container components to separate concerns.
- **Server-State Libraries**: Consider libraries like [react-query](https://github.com/tanstack/query), [apollo client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) to handle server state.

### Global State

Considerations for managing state that's shared across many parts of your application.

- **Discouraged Generally**: Assess if something truly needs to be global, as it can add complexity.
- **Use Zustand or Context if Needed**: If global state is necessary, prefer lighter solutions like [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) or Context over heavier libraries like Redux.

These guidelines provide a roadmap for managing data in React applications, balancing simplicity with flexibility to build scalable and maintainable code.
