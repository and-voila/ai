## Null & Undefined in TypeScript: A Guided Approach

In TypeScript, the types `null` and `undefined` often seem interchangeable. However, for the sake of consistency and clear communication, follow these guidelines:

- Use `null` to clearly signal that a variable is intentionally without a value, whether in assignments or return types of functions.
- Opt for `undefined` when you intend to exclude fields, such as in form fields, request payloads, or database queries. The difference can be crucial in certain scenarios like when using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/null-and-undefined).

### A brief example

```ts
// Using null for intentional absence
const user: { name: string | null } = { name: null };

// Using undefined to exclude fields
const query = { name: undefined };
```

These distinctions might seem subtle, but they add clarity to your code and align with modern TypeScript practices.
