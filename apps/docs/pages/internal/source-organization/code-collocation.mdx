## Code Collocation

Organizing code is a crucial aspect of software maintenance and ease of collaboration. In a monorepo, it's essential to adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Group by Feature**: Ensure that every application or package in the monorepo has its project files and folders organized and grouped by specific features. This approach emphasizes the functionality of different code parts and helps in locating them quickly.

- **Relevancy Proximity**: Collocate code as close as possible to where it's relevant. This principle aids in creating a logical structure that resonates with the software's real-world model, making it more intuitive to follow and modify.

- **Embrace Deep Nesting**: Don't be afraid of deep folder nesting. A well-structured hierarchy can facilitate better understanding and navigation, even if it involves several layers. The key is to maintain clear and consistent naming conventions to avoid confusion.

By adhering to these principles, you can create a codebase that is more maintainable, navigable, and in line with modern best practices.
