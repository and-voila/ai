## About This Guide

Our TypeScript Style Guide showcases our precision, uniformity, and creativity in coding. It sets conventions that may seem arbitrary but govern our code consistently.

"Consistency is key," and this guide ensures it by automating many rules with tools like ESLint, TypeScript, and Prettier. Design and architectural decisions are also detailed in the conventions below.

### Required Tools:

- [TypeScript v5](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)
- [typescript-eslint v6](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) with [`strict-type-checked`](https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/configs/#strict-type-checked), [`stylistic-type-checked`](https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/configs/#stylistic-type-checked) configurations.

### Assumptions:

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react): Frontend conventions.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/): Testing conventions.
