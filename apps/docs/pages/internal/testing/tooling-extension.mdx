## Tooling Extension for Testing in VS Code

In a development environment, particularly within large codebases (like monorepos), running individual tests promptly is essential. While npm scripts can execute tests, using the [Jest Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firsttris.vscode-jest-runner) extension for Visual Studio Code offers a more efficient and user-friendly experience.

This tool allows you to run any single test [instantly](https://github.com/mkosir/typescript-style-guide/raw/main/misc/vscode-jest-runner.gif), reducing the time spent on test execution.

To install the Jest Runner extension, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
code --install-extension firsttris.vscode-jest-runner
```

Integrating this extension into your workflow will streamline the testing process, making it more responsive and aligned with the iterative nature of development.
