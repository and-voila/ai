# The And Voila Admin Console

Our internal admin console will be the command center where office staff can manage all aspects of And Voila from users to analytics.

Built on [**Retool**](https://retool.com/), it will provide a flexible workspace to quickly build custom internal tools and workflows.

The admin console aims to be a one-stop shop to orchestrate the And Voila ecosystem, eliminating disparate systems clutter. Key info accessible in one place - as focused as Charlie's rat extermination skills.

**Planned features include:**

- User management
- Support ticketing
- Analytics dashboards
- Billing and payments
- Product metrics

Although in early stages, the admin console will be the mission control center keeping And Voila operating smoothly. Stay tuned for its launch!
