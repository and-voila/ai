## Data Immutability - A Core Principle

Data immutability is a cornerstone of our coding practice. The majority of the data should be treated as immutable. This includes the usage of constructs like `Readonly`, `ReadonlyArray`, always returning new arrays, objects, etc., to maintain integrity.

### Why Immutability?

Immutability enhances code reliability and predictability, reduces complexity, and facilitates easier testing. When data is immutable, it simplifies debugging and tracing data changes throughout the application's life cycle.

### Best Practices

- **Keep Objects Small:** Smaller data objects reduce cognitive load, making the code more understandable and maintainable for future developers.

- **Use Immutability Constructs:** Employ `Readonly`, `ReadonlyArray`, etc., to enforce immutability where appropriate.

- **Create New Instances:** Always return new arrays or objects to ensure that the original data remains unchanged.

### Exceptions to Immutability

Though immutability is favored, there are scenarios where mutations are justifiable:

- **Complex Objects:** When dealing with intricate structures that require a considerable amount of manipulation.

- **Performance Considerations:** When immutability could lead to performance degradation, controlled mutations might be preferable.

Remember, these exceptions should be used sparingly and only in cases where they are truly necessary. Always strive to maintain immutability as a default principle, as it fosters a more robust, maintainable, and transparent codebase.
