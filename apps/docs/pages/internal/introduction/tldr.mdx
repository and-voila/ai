## TLDR - Key Principles

Here are essential conventions for consistent and effective coding:

- **Organization:** Collocate code with usage; group by features.

- **Immutability:** Prefer immutable data; use pure functions.

- **Function Purity:** Functions must be stateless, with a single responsibility.

- **Arguments:** Favor required over optional arguments.

- **Naming:** Adopt consistent, intention-revealing names.

- **Exports:** Prefer named exports over default.

- **Data Fetching:** Use react-query or Apollo Client.

- **Global State:** Minimize use of global state management libraries.

- **Components:** Display data, emit events; no business logic.

- **Testing:** Focus on behavior, not implementation.

These principles lay a solid foundation. Emphasize consistency, immutability, purity, clarity in code, and proper testing.
