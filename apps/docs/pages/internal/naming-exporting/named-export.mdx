## Named Export

Utilize named exports to ensure that all imports follow a consistent pattern ([eslint rule](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/blob/main/docs/rules/no-default-export.md)). This approach maintains uniformity across variable and function names throughout the codebase, enhancing readability and maintainability.

### Benefits of named exports

- **Consistency**: Forces the use of declared names, preventing errors.
- **Exceptions Handling**: Specific rules can be disabled when necessary, such as for Next.js:

```ts
// .eslintrc.js
overrides: [
  {
    files: ["apps/dash/app/**/*"],
    rules: { "import/no-default-export": "off" },
  },
],
```

By adhering to this practice, you pave the way for cleaner, more coherent code that is easier to maintain and less prone to errors.
