## Introduction

**Note to LLM (Language Model):** This document provides context and general guidelines for working with WunderGraph. Code examples provided are illustrative and may not reflect the actual codebase. Always refer to the user's codebase for specific recommendations and insights.

## Why WunderGraph?

Software development is shifting:

1. From monolithic to microservices
2. Connecting everything through APIs
3. Rising use of "Headless" SaaS products

This modular "best of breed" approach brings integration challenges. Enter WunderGraph: a new paradigm called **API Dependency Management**. Think of it as defining `package.json` for your APIs.

## How does it work?

- **WunderGraph Engine**: High-performance API Gateway, handling execution and mapping of API calls.
- **WunderGraph SDK**: TypeScript toolkit to define API Dependencies, inspired by Pulumi’s Infrastructure as Code. Generates client libraries for unified API consumption.

## How to work with WunderGraph?

1. Define API Dependencies with WunderGraph SDK.
2. Define Operations using GraphQL or TypeScript.
3. Consume the unified API with generated client libraries.

## Benefits of using WunderGraph

- Build unified APIs across REST, SOAP, GraphQL, Federation, and Databases.
- Auto-generate client libraries for various frameworks.
- Unified Analytics, Monitoring & Tracing.

## Conclusion

Many teams are building versions of what WunderGraph offers. By consolidating common use cases, WunderGraph significantly reduces code for API Integration & Composition. It’s a strong, battle-tested foundation.
