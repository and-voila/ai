For creators and artists, emerging generative AI raises pressing questions around intellectual property. As models ingest vast training data, is your IP being misused without consent? And if not, how can you prove original ownership as AI-generated content proliferates?

At And Voila, we saw creators' need for tools to track IP usage, establish rights, control distribution, and monetize work in the age of generative models. So we built an integrated solution centered on protection.

## Understanding the Risks

Large language models like GPT-3 ingest billions of web pages and documents as training data without compensation to the creators. The legal implications around IP and copyright are hazy at best in these early days.

But creators rightly feel uneasy at the thought of their hard work being used to enrich big tech without permission or payment. Even if current laws allow it, the practice raises complex ethical questions.

Beyond potential scraping of work, AI generative models allow anyone to produce passable content in almost any style. When AI-generated work floods the market, how can you definitively prove your human authorship and ownership?

## And Voila's Solution

To address these pressing issues, And Voila leverages blockchain to provide robust proof of your original content's provenance. Our platform lets you:

- Generate an unalterable record of your copyright via an NFT-backed digital title

- Control the distribution of your work by setting access permissions and licensing terms

- Securely track each instance of your work being referenced or repurposed

- Safely monetize your content by setting pricing, usage limits, and royalties

By tackling IP protection, attribution, and compensation, And Voila aims to give creators peace of mind creating in the AI era. We believe every imaginative work holds inherent value deserving of protection.
