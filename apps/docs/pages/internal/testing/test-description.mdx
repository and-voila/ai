## Test Description in React

Proper naming conventions in testing help in understanding the purpose and scenario of the test. Implement a consistent pattern using the `it('should ... when ...')` format. This ensures that test descriptions clearly express the expected behavior and conditions.

An [Eslint rule](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest/blob/main/docs/rules/valid-title.md#mustmatch--mustnotmatch) can enforce this convention:

```ts
// .eslintrc.js
'jest/valid-title': [
  'error',
  {
    mustMatch: { it: [/should.*when/u.source, "Test title must include 'should' and 'when'"] },
  },
];
```

### Example:

```ts
// ❌ Avoid
it('accepts ISO date format where date is parsed and formatted as YYYY-MM');
it('after title is confirmed user description is rendered');

// ✅ Correct
it('should return parsed date as YYYY-MM when input is in ISO date format');
it('should render user description when title is confirmed');
```

By following this convention, tests become more readable and maintainable, providing clear insight into what is being tested and under what conditions.
