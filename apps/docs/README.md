# Enlightening Minds: The And Voila Docs Hub

Our centralized documentation hub powered by [**Nextra**](https://nextra.site/) is the lighthouse guiding users and developers.

Built with [**MDX**](https://mdxjs.com/), our docs source their wisdom directly from markdown files. Like Charlie's flourishing coaching skills, contributions can come from the community through GitHub.

[**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) brings its utility-first design for a stylish yet minimalist look. The content shines while the UI gets out of the way.

Within the sleek docs site, you'll find:

- **User Guides**: Curated walkthroughs for new users to upskill quickly.

- **Developer Docs**: Technical reference for building on our platform.

- **Internal Docs**: Resources for our team to align efforts and knowledge.

Nextra helps us tame documentation sprawl with its structured approach. And with markdown, the barrier to contribute is low - no need to have React skills like Mac mastering martial arts.

Our `/docs` workspace enlightens minds across the And Voila ecosystem. Let it guide you to the information you seek!
