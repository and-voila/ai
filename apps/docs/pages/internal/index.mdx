### Why TypeScript?

TypeScript is more than just a language; it's the backbone of our entire development ecosystem. At And Voila AI, we use TypeScript to ensure:

- **Strong Typing**: Safety first! Catch errors early and code with confidence.
- **Scalability**: Our entire stack is TS optimized. It makes scaling our apps and packages consistent and efficient.
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared understanding and consistency across all codebases.
- **Robustness**: From the [Turborepo](https://turbo.build) to our shared UI components, TypeScript ensures our code is robust and maintainable.

### TS Optimized Stack

We’ve chosen tools that synergize with TypeScript, forming a cohesive unit:

- [Next JS](https://nextjs.org): Powering fast, seamless user experiences.
