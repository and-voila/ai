## Naming in Code

Aside from cache invalidation's notorious complexity, naming is seen as the second most challenging aspect of programming. A well-chosen name can communicate essential context, making the code more readable.

Consider the following:

- **Consistency**: Uniform naming throughout the codebase aids understanding.
- **Clarity**: Select names that describe the element's purpose or functionality.
- **Maintainability**: Write mindful of future readers, whether others or your future self.

Remember, clear naming isn't merely an aesthetic choice; it's a critical part of writing maintainable code.
