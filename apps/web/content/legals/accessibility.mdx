## Our Commitment to Accessibility

And Voila AI, Inc. (And Voila) is committed to providing an accessible experience for all users. We aim to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standards to ensure the content on andvoila.ai is accessible to as many people as possible.

### Providing Feedback

Accessibility is an ongoing process, and we are continuously evaluating and improving the accessibility of our site. If you encounter any accessibility barriers on And Voila, [please contact us](/contact). We welcome your feedback on how we can improve.

### Content Best Practices

All content on And Voila aims to be keyboard-friendly, screen reader-friendly, and adhere to best practices for color contrast ratios, focus visibility, and link distinction. Our content is written in plain language and with inclusive, human-friendly terminology whenever possible.

### Alternative Text

Images on the site often contain embedded alternative text descriptions so that screen reader users understand the context and meaning.

### Captions and Transcripts

Videos on the site are always captioned, and transcripts are provided when needed. The And Voila team puts accessibility at the forefront of all new feature development and content creation.

### Resizable Text

The And Voila website is designed to dynamically resize text for users with low vision or in high-text zoom environments. All content remains accessible at larger text sizes without horizontal scroll bars, which ensures readability for the widest range of readers.

### Room for Improvement

While we aim for full compliance, there remain some areas that could use improvement to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Our statement on accessibility is not and should not be construed as a claim of WCAG 2.1 AA conformance. We see accessibility as an journey, not a destination, and pledge to continuously evaluate and improve the accessibility of our website.

### Providing Alternate Formats

If you need information in a different format due to your disability, [please contact us](/contact). We will work to provide the information you need in a suitable format as quickly as possible. Our goal is for all readers to have equal access to content and community on And Voila.

### Appreciating Your Feedback
