## Internal Introduction

This style guide provides best practices and conventions for writing clean, maintainable TypeScript code in our Next.js application. As our codebase grows, following consistent styles and patterns will help us work together efficiently and keep our app reliable.

Adhering to these guidelines will:

- Improve code quality through consistent, idiomatic TypeScript
- Enhance readability and maintainability
- Reduce errors and bugs
- Streamline collaboration between developers
- Accelerate onboarding for new team members

While these rules aim to standardize our practices, they are not exhaustive. Use your best judgment and always prioritize readability and simplicity. Suggest improvements to the guide as we learn and evolve our process.
