## Embracing Single Object Arguments

In designing functions, using a single object as an argument instead of multiple ones can improve readability and make the function more adaptable to future changes. This approach is commonly used, except in cases where there's only one primitive argument.

Consider the advantages:

### Clarity and Extensibility

When a function accepts numerous parameters, understanding their order and purpose can become confusing. By encapsulating these parameters within a single object, you create a more legible interface, and it becomes easier to add, remove, or modify arguments in the future.

### An illustrative example

```ts
// ❌ Avoid having multiple arguments - confusing and inflexible
transformUserInput('client', false, 60, 120, null, true, 2000);

// ✅ Use options object as an argument - clear and extensible
transformUserInput({
  method: 'client',
  isValidated: false,
  minLines: 60,
  maxLines: 120,
  defaultInput: null,
  shouldLog: true,
  timeout: 2000,
});
```
