## Developers About

This style guide defines conventions and best practices for TypeScript development in our codebase. The goals are to:

- Enforce consistency across our codebase
- Improve maintainability as our app grows
- Accelerate onboarding for new team members
- Promote best practices that produce robust, reliable code

As with any opinionated guide, these rules are somewhat arbitrary. But consistency is key - it's better for the team to align on conventions upfront than debate styles continually.

The guide leverages tooling like ESLint, Prettier, and the TypeScript compiler to automate many of the rules. But certain architectural and design decisions still require human discretion.

### Technology Stack

This guide assumes the use of:

- **TypeScript 5** - Strong typing and newest features
- **ESLint** - Linting rules enforced
- **Prettier** - Code formatted consistently
- **React** - Frontend UI library
- **Jest** - Testing framework
- **Testing Library** - Browser testing utilities

The principles can extend to other libraries and frameworks, but examples focus on our core stack.

### Contributing

As we learn and improve, suggest changes to the guide. Add clarifications, amend rules, or propose new conventions.
