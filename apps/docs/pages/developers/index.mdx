# Developers Welcome!

Welcome to the AI-powered app documentation site. If our AI were any smarter, it would probably write this guide itself, but we decided to keep some jobs for humans.

## Table of Contents

1. [Headers](#headers) - The Shouty Bits
2. [Links](#links) - Internet's Rabbit Holes
3. [Images](#images) - Worth a Thousand Typos
4. [Code Blocks](#code-blocks) - Nerds' Poetry
5. [Lists](#lists) - Organized Chaos
6. [Tables](#tables) - Not the Furniture
7. [Quotes](#quotes) - Wisdom or Nonsense?

### Headers

Headers are the loud neighbors of the text world. They're always shouting, but at least they make themselves clear.

# H1 - "I'm the boss here!"

## H2 - "Look at me, I'm important too!"

### H3 - "Hey, don't forget about me!"

#### H4 - "I'm still here, just a bit quieter."

##### H5 - "Can anyone hear me?"

###### H6 - "Okay, I'll just whisper then."

### Links

Links are like portals to other dimensions. Click one, and who knows where you'll end up? Probably distracted.

[Click here if you dare](https://example.com)

### Images

Images are here to save you when words fail. Because who reads nowadays?

### Code Blocks

Code blocks are like poetry for nerds. Beautiful, elegant, and utterly incomprehensible to most people.

```javascript
export default {
  useNextSeoProps() {
    const { asPath } = useRouter();
    if (asPath !== '/') {
      return {
        titleTemplate: '%s â€“ SWR',
      };
    }
  },
};
```

## Lists

Lists are for people who love order but hate tables. They're like the Marie Kondo of text.

- Unordered chaos
- Chaos with bullets
  - Chaos within chaos

1. Ordered chaos
2. Chaos with numbers

## Tables

Tables are like lists, but with commitment issues. They can't decide what they want to be, so they're everything at once.

| Header 1     | Header 2        |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Cell 1 - Bed | Cell 2 - Sofa   |
| Cell 3 - TV  | Cell 4 - Fridge |

## Quotes

Quotes are when you want to sound wise but don't want to think too hard.

> "This is a blockquote. It's like a quote but with a block. Profound, right?"
